# About

This simple project aims to create a simple neural network from scratch, and train it with the MNIST database, to make him recongnise handwritten digits.

# Usage

## Performance benchmark

The project can be run to benchmark his performance, both **with and without convolution**,
benchamrking is done in learning, and recognition.

## Interactive usage

You can also play with an interactive gui, drawing your own number and see what the trained model guess.

# Dataset

the dataset used is the **MNIST Databse** of handwritten digits containing a training set of 60k samples, and a testing set of 10k samples.\
The data are stored in the _IDX_ file format.
