# About
This crate is solving the mnist dataset of handwritten digit using our custom made neural network library

# Dataset
the dataset used is the **MNIST Databse** of handwritten digits containing a training set of 60k samples, and a testing set of 10k samples.\
the files are stored inside the [resources folder](./resources/), there is 4 files

- [training set images](./resources/train-images-idx3-ubyte.gz)
- [training set labels](./resources/train-images-idx1-ubyte.gz)
- [test set images](./resources/t10k-images-idx3-ubyte.gz)
- [test set labels](./resources/train-images-idx1-ubyte.gz)

  At the time we wrote the program, the files in the [official respository](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) where unavaible, we downloaded the version from [this mirror](https://github.com/mkolod/MNIST).
